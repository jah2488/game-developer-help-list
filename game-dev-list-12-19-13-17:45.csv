@ibasteevenly,Steve Bailey,IHS/Screen Digest,"Games from a contemporary business perspective. This will *not* result in any consumer-facing coverage, just offering up my wonky ear and lopsided mouth as a disposable human FAQ, if it's useful to anyone. I used to be a journalist covering product-centric (sorry) gaming, before shifting into the service-oriented (sorry) landscape upon becoming an analyst five years ago - the parallels and contrasts are both fascinating and more than a wee bit dizzying. But happy to lend basic advice on countries/value chain/buzzwords etc.","I try to be format/sector agnostic, and I'm not here to share any of the professional intel that my job centers on. But if you want to natter about Google+'s undulations as a games platform, or understand what the hell deferred revenue is, or pointers for key companies to seek out in payment & billing or whatever, drop me a nudge.","Currently an analyst - based in London - I've been bimbling around the UK games industry for some 15 years now, and more than happy to chat games on whatever level. Or you want to just try to convince me that analysts are glorified scam-artists, rather than fussy interpolators. Basically, willing conversations aren't just my favourite part of the gaming world, but they make the damned thing go round in the first place."

I'll try to fix that in the future.","If you want my attention in a hurry you can tweet links at me since it makes me feel special to be tweeted at and I check it compulsively.
